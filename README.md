What You Will Learn: This assignment will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Ruby.


Disclaimer: This assignment is about walking you through the fundamental features of the Ruby language using short, simplified code examples. If you find yourself wondering "why would I ever write this code?" or "ok, but what is this thing for?", try not to panic! Today's assignment is about discovering what is possible in Ruby, not why those features are useful. However, if you can start to envision how you might use these features in more complicated programming scenarios, that's great! Moreover, if you leave a section but felt like you didn't quite understand, it's very helpful to experiment and explore on your own.
