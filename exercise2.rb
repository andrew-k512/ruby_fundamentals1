# Q1: How would you calculate a good tip for a 55 dolar meal?
# Use puts to print the answer.
# I would mutiply 55 * .1.

puts "Answer 1: I mutiply the meal amount by .1 to get a tip of
ten percent. So for a $55 meal the tip is $#{55 * 0.1}."

# Q2 Try adding a string and an integer with the + operator.
# What happens? Find a way to convert the integer into a string
# first and use puts to print the result.

puts "Answer 2: Gives an error, and the third line combines the string
\"age\" with the integer 27 into one string which says age 27."

puts "Age " + 27.to_s

#Try outputting the result of 45628 multiplied by 7839 in a
# sentence by using string interpolation.

puts "Answer 3: 45628 multiplied by 7839 equals #{45628 * 7839}."

# What's the value of the expression
# (10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)?
#Try figuring it out on your own before typing it in.

puts "Answer 4: The answer is true, because the right side of the OR equation
is true. "
